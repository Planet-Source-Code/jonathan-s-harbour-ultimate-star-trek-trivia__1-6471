<LI><I>Stardate 48315.6:</I> A starship controlled by the Maquis mysteriously
disappears in the Badlands, a charged energy field near the demilitarized
zone, after being pursued by a Cardassian ship. USS Voyager, commanded
by Captain Janeway, is dispatched from DS9 to the Badlands to find out
where the Maquis ship went, especially since a Starfleet security operative,
Vulcan Lt. Tuvok, was aboard. Arriving in the Badlands, the Voyager is
scanned by an unknown presence and then ripped out of the Alpha Quadrant
by a subspace phenomenon that causes heavy damage and kills many of the
crew. Voyager ends up in an unexplored part of the galaxy where the first
thing the crew sees is an enegry collection array. While repairs are being
made, Janeway and her crew are kidnapped from the ship via transporter
and deposited in a virtual reality, the inhabitants of which conduct experiments
on the Alpha Quadrant visitors and then return them - minus helmsman Ensign
Kim. Making contact with the Maquis crew commanded by Chakotay, Janeway
discovers that the same tests were forced upon the renegades and that one
of their number has also been abducted. A tenuous truce is arranged so
that both crews can recover their missing comrades. Ensign Kim and Maquis
engineer B'elanna Torres, in the meantime, have been beamed to the planet
Ocampa, a barren wasteland of a world whose short-lived inhabitants live
underground. There they are attended to by the Ocampa, who have been instructed
by the Caretaker to look after the two visitors since they have somehow
become infected with a terminal illness. Voyager's crew track their missing
comrades to Ocampa and encounter the scavenger Neelix, who offers to be
the crew's guide through this part of space. His knowledge of the local
area is invaluable, such as the revelation that water is a rarity and is
valuable currency here. The crew is also introduced to the Kazons, who
roam the surface of Ocampa foraging a meager existence. They hand over
a captive Ocampa named Kes in exchange for some water from Voyager. Shortly
after Kes leads the crew to Kim and Torres, the energy array shuts down
after transmitting a final burst of power to Ocampa. The Kazons make a
gambit to claim the array for themselves, but Chakotay and Tom Paris, a
dishonored former Maquis member aboard the Voyager, battle the scavengers
off with their respective starships as Janeway and Tuvok beam to the array
and find the elderly and dying Caretaker, whose race accidentally destroyed
the Ocampan ecosphere and then built the subterranean habitat and the power
array so the Ocampa could survive. The Caretaker must be succeeded by another
and has been trying to find a replacement for decades, but so far all of
those tested for their suitability - such as Kim and Torres - have not
proven adequate to the task. The Caretaker decides to set the array to
self-destruct to avoid allowing the Ocampa to be enslaved by the Kazons.
In the fierce battle with the Kazons, Chakotay's Maquis ship is destroyed
when he rams it into the lead Kazon ship, which then collides with the
array, disabling the self-destruct sequence. Janeway beams back to the
Voyager and destroys the array herself, though it could have sent her and
her crew back to the Alpha Quadrant. The Kazons swear vengeance should
they encounter Voyager again. With the surviving members of the Maquis
and Starfleet crews both safely aboard Voyager - and with Kes and Neelix
in tow - the ship sets a course back home, E.T.A.: 75 years... </LI>

<LI><I>Notes:</I> This was easily the most troubled Star Trek series pilot
since &quot;The Cage&quot; was rejected in 1965 by NBC. Internal problems
in mounting Paramount's new network made the show's future uncertain as
to whether it would be a network production or syndicated. Academy Award-winning
French Canadian actress Genevieve Bujold then accepted the role of Janeway,
only to resign from the show three days into filming due to the hectic
pace of TV production and, according to some sources, a disagreement with
director Winrich Kolbe. At this point, forces within Viacom tried to exert
pressure to make Janeway a male character, having resisted the suggestion
of a female lead all along. Other voices in the executive ranks suggested
- since the other shows comprising Paramount's new network were even further
behind schedule than &quot;Voyager&quot; - that the ever more problematic
gestation of the fifth network should be ended, lest the network take to
the air and fail, taking dozens of new affiliate stations with it. In the
space of a week, Kate Mulgrew was cast for the role as production continued
with the cast and crew trying to maneuver around the lack of a captain
in the meantime. The theme for the show's opening titles was composed by
Jerry Goldsmith, who had scored the first and fifth Trek movies, the theme
from which was also adapted to serve as the score for Star Trek: The Next
Generation. (Goldsmith's latest entry into Trek's otherwise drab musical
canon later won the Emmy for main theme music in September 1995.) The show
premiered on schedule on UPN.</LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 48439.7:</I> B'elanna Torres faces the prospect of a court-martial
after hitting Carey, the senior surviving member of Voyager's engineering
crew, and Janeway balks when Chakotay nominates Torres for the position
of chief engineer. Before a choice can be made, Voyager encounters a quantum
singularity that appears to have trapped a ship. After an attempt to snag
the distant derelict with the tractor beam, Voyager is forced to back off
as the crew hatches alternate plans to retrieve the other ship. At Chakotay's
insistence, Janeway includes Torres in the process, and B'elanna manages
to come up with a working theory that the other ship is Voyager, already
trapped in the singularity. If she can manage to free the ship from the
phenomenon, B'elanna may prove herself adequate to the task of becoming
Voyager's chief engineer. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> Exploring a planet which has very recently
been rendered uninhabitable by a global disaster, Janeway and Paris are
separated from the rest of their away team and somehow find themselves
in the same place, but hours before the cataclysm that consumed the planet's
entire civilization. Their attempts to remain anonymous while trying to
find a way back to their own present land them in the middle of a protest
against a polaric energy plant, which may be the cause of the world's destruction.
At first, Janeway is adamant that the Prime Directive be adhered to, but
when she discovers the possibility that her presence may have caused the
disaster in the first place, the captain decides to set aside Starfleet's
first rule. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 48532.4:</I> Searching for deposits of refinable dilithium,
Voyager stops off at a moon, where Chakotay, Kim and Neelix beam to the
surface. It turns out that this moon is not uninhabited. A group of aliens
there seem to have left a dilithium trail, and one of them attacks Neelix.
When the others come to his aid, Neelix's lungs have been removed, and
only some innovative but risky gambles taken by Voyager's holographic doctor
can keep him barely alive. The aliens flee the moon in their own ship,
and Janeway orders a pursuit. It turns out that the attackers are simply
trying to survive themselves, their species all but wiped out by a deadly
disease. Their only hope for survival is to take working organs from others
- and they cannot return to lungs to Neelix, for they have already been
used. </LI>

entry injures the creature, and Voyager barely makes it back into open

<LI><I>Stardate 48579.4:</I> Harry's sensor sweeps for space anomalies
detect a wormhole which Janeway diverts Voyager off course to investigate.
Though a probe is able to determine that the wormhole leads homeward to
the Alpha Quadrant, the wormhole is too small to travel through. When the
probe is scanned by a ship on the other side, the crew begin using it as
a relay satellite and make contact with a Romulan ship. Though the Romulan
captain is skeptical of Janeway's claim that Voyager is in the Delta Quadrant,
he eventually realizes the truth and offers to help transmit messages home.
Later, B'elanna discovers a possible way to beam through the wormhole to
the Romulan ship, but this method of returning to the Alpha Quadrant is
halted by an unforseeable problem. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> Kim returns alone in a shuttle from a trip
to Benea which he made with Tom Paris. After getting entangled with a scientist's
wife, and by all accounts murdering the scientist in question, Paris has
been sentenced to relive the crime from the victim's point of view every
14 hours. Janeway, despite Tom's admittedly less-than-exemplary record,
needs to know for herself if Tom is guilty of the crime. When it turns
out that the Benean punishment is reacting badly to Tom's human physiology,
he is taken back to Voyager. Mysteries begin to pile up - why are the neighboring
warlike Numiri attacking Voyager? And who really committed to murder? The
answers can only come from one source - Tuvok must mind-meld with Paris
to experience the forced reenactment of the incident himself. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 48623.5:</I> Investigating the possibility of a new element
detected in the rocky bodies comprising a planet's ring system, an away
team beams down to one of the asteroids and finds the ground littered with
dead bodies encased in a residual shell. As the away team conducts a visual
survey - at Chakotay's request to avoid desecrating the ritually-disposed-of
deceased - a subspace phenomenon occurs, prompting an emergency beam-out.
But when the away team transports back to Voyager, Kim doesn't return,
his place taken by a newly-arrived body. Harry finds himself among a race
of ritualistic people who believe he has returned from their afterlife,
and is constantly besieged with questions about &quot;the next emanation.&quot;
An alien named Patera, in the meantime, is revived about Voyager. She finds
herself losing faith in the possibility of the next life, while Harry is
the subject of intense curiosity and study by Patera's people. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 48642.5:</I> Voyager is intercepted by a ship from Sakarris,
an planet with an advanced culture renowned for its hospitality; Sakarran
magistrate Gath offers an extended visit to his planet, which Janeway accepts.
During this visit, Harry finds out that the Sakarrans have developed transportation
technology that could send Voyager at least halfway home, if not all the
way. But the Sakarrans have their own rule - much like Starfleet's Prime
Directive - that will not permit them to share this technology with less
advanced cultures. However, a faction on Sakarris is willing to exchange
a sample of their trajector with Voyager's crew in exchange for something
only the outsiders can offer. Janeway will not conduct an unofficial or
illegal exchange, but she finds out that there are those among her crew
who will. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> A visit to the surface of a habitable planet
becomes less than routine when a Kazon ship is detected nearby. All away
teams are recalled to Voyager, but Seska can't be found. Chakotay finds
her in a cave nearby, where the two of them are attacked by Kazons but
escape. The Kazon ship is sending a distress signal, and despite her own
misgivings and Neelix's warnings, Janeway sends an away team to the ship.
It is discovered that the Kazons somehow acquired some Federation technology
and suffered a fatal accident while trying to install it on their ship.
Other Kazon ships are on the way, and Janeway faces the possibility that
someone aboard Voyager has decided to ally themselves with the enemy. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 48693.2:</I> As Voyager passes near a protostar, Janeway
and Torres try to beam some samples of its photonic material aboard. When
they try to enlist Harry's help in studying it, they find that he has disappeared
from the ship. Chakotay and Tuvok go to where Harry was last found - the
holodeck - and try to learn what happened to their comrade by interacting
with Harry's Beowulf holodeck program. Even Chakotay and Tuvok vanish when
Grendel comes to ravage the Hall Heorot. Someone needs to venture into
the holodeck to find where the missing crewmen are going, or if they're
still alive. Into Hrothgar's keep steps a new warrior, the only member
of Voyager's crew immune to the threat of being snatched out of the holodeck.
The affair of Grendel was made known to him on his native soil; space travelers
said that this hall, best of holo-scenarios, stands empty and useless to
all warriors after the evening light becomes hidden beneath the cover of
the sky. Therefore his people - or specifically Captain Janeway - advised
that he should investigate because they know what his strength can accomplish...but
can the holographic doctor grapple with something other than a medical
emergency? </LI>

of sabotage prevent Janeway from taking Voyager into the nebula to investigate,
it becomes evident that an alien consciousness is loose aboard the ship,
moving from person to person in order to keep Voyager out of the nebula.
Another presence then makes itself known, this one hell-bent on taking
the ship into danger. </LI>

structure. In one experiment, Vidiian surgeon Sulan splits B'elanna into
two entirely separate beings, one Klingon, the other human. B'elanna's
human side is timid and weak compared to her powerful warrior half, who
escapes from Sulan's lab. A gamble by Chakotay pays off in rescuing the
surviving crew members from the Vidiians, but B'elanna - despite her desire
to be free of her hot-tempered Klingon half - will die unless she is reintegrated.

where the crew finds a centuries-old land vehicle from Earth drifting through
space. When Paris manages to start the old truck, Harry's curiosity about
its AM radio uncovers an equally ancient S.O.S. coming from a nearby planet.
Janeway, hoping that whatever brought the truck and the source of the distress
call to the Delta Quadrant could be found and used to send Voyager home,
orders a landing. A vintage airplane is found on the surface with an alien
power supply keeping the S.O.S. on the air, and eight alien-abducted humans
are found in stasis chambers also constructed by an alien intelligence.
The 20th century humans are revived, and Janeway finds that among them
is the long-lost pioneer female aviator Amelia Earhart. Also living on
the planet are the descendants of other abducted humans, now masters of
their world since they overthrew their forebears' kidnappers. Once all
parties are convinced that the Voyager crew are who they claim to be, the
opportunity to settle down on this Earthlike world is offered to the wayward
travelers. </LI>

a solitary ritual commemorating his father, Chakotay is attacked by a Kazon-Ogla
vessel. When he destroys the attacking craft and rescues the lone pilot,
he discovers that his opponent is a young boy trying to make his mark in
Kazon society by killing an enemy; the price of the boy's failure is ostracism
from his culture. Chakotay is faced with the dilemma of saving his own

<LI><I>Stardate 48892.1:</I> The holographic doctor's day is not off to
a good start. Automatically brought online by a red alert, he finds that
the ship has - according to the computer - been abandoned after a Kazon
attack. But this turns out to be wrong when Torres shows up to enlist the
doctor's help in aiding the injured Janeway on the bridge. Thanks to a
holographic projection system that can transfer the doctor to key parts
of the ship other than sick bay, he visits the bridge for the first time,
and is then off to the mess hall to help Neelix fend off a lone Kazon.
At this point, however, the doctor's grip on reality is loosened when he
finds that not only can he bleed, but according to every available tricorder
he is the only living thing on board Voyager. He begins to believe these
incredible things when a holography engineer named Barclay appears and
insists that the doctor is in fact Dr. Louis Zimmerman, a holo-programmer
trapped in a holodeck emergency simulation in the Alpha Quadrant. </LI>

crew turns out to be a swarm of space-dwelling life forms whose electrophoretic
emissions cause sudden hormonal maturation in Kes. She spontaneously enters
the Elogium in preparation to have a child, which she desperately wants.
Neelix is troubled by the thought of becoming a father and seeks the advice
of Tuvok. Kes' condition causes Janeway to wonder about the implications
of raising families aboard Voyager, but the crew's immediate concern is
the dominant member of the swarm, which views the ship as a rival for mates.

space. When the Botha rendezvous with Voyager, they launch an unprovoked
attack. As they maneuver to resist the attack, Voyager's crew are overcome
by hallucinations which disable everyone on the ship except the Doctor
and Kes, whose nascent telepathic powers enable her to resist the hallucinations.
The fate of the crew hinges on their ability to find a way to repel the

Voyager becomes stranded when its antimatter supply begins to drain with

When a Vidiian ship arrives and the organ harvesters board Voyager and

Janeway is surprised when a hail is received from an automated system.
The message describes the disaster that devastated the planet and the cryogenically
frozen handful of survivors. Janeway has the survivors beamed up, and Harry
determines that their minds are linked in a complex computer system. Some
of the survivors have not, in fact, survived, and the doctor suspects some
kind of trauma; it is also discovered that the frozen survivors should
have been revived long ago. Harry and B'elanna are linked to the computer
and pay a visit to the artificial reality that the survivors' minds inhabit.
It turns out to be a bizarre circus environment which is ruled by a malevolent
clown known as Fear, who intends to keep the remaining survivors trapped
in their interactive system to preserve his own existence. One of the captives
reveals that the cyrogenically frozen corpses were killed by Fear. Fear
allows Torres to leave the system, but Harry is its hostage. The doctor
is sent in to negotiate with Fear, but is unable to make any headway and
another of the survivors is killed when Fear discovers an attempt to shut
the system down. Finally, Fear agrees to an exchange of all of his hostages
for a new victim: Janeway herself. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 49655.2:</I> Tuvok and Neelix are sent on an away mission
to collect samples of vegetation from a nearby planet. When they are beamed
back up, a transporter glitch combines them into one being, a Vulcan-Talaxian
fusion that eventually calls itself Tuvix. Tuvix has the knowledge, memories
and personalities of both Tuvok and Neelix, from Tuvok's expertise and
logic to Neelix's quirky emotions and his love for Kes. Despite the crew's
concerns about their two comrades, Tuvix is perfectly healthy and resumes
both Tuvok's tactical duties and even some of Neelix's cooking. After several
weeks, the doctor comes up with a means of splitting Tuvix back into his

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> Janeway and Chakotay, infected with a virus,
are awakened from stasis and find themselves on the planet where they contracted
the illness. The doctor's research indicates that leving the planet would
prove fatal for them, and suggests contacting the medically advanced Vidiians
for help, having failed to discover a cure himself. Survival provisions
are sent to the planet, and Janeway hands command over to Tuvok and orders
him to give the Vidiians a wide berth for the crew's safety. As Janeway
and Chakotay adjust to life in their new home and outside of the formal
command structure to which they are accustomed, Tuvok orders the ship to
steer clear of a Vidiian convoy despite the protests of many of the crew.
A violent storm on the planet wrecks the equipment Janeway has been using
to conduct her own research on the virus, and she finally begins to resign
herself to the possibility that she and Chakotay may have to settle into
the roles of Adam and Eve. Tuvok finally consents to contact the Vidiians,
but despite the fact that the doctor's old flame Dr. Denara Pel offers
an antidote to the disease, her fellow Vidiians carry out a relentless
ambush on Voyager. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> Voyager receives a message from an automated
buoy sent by Seska, begging Chakotay to rescue her and the child she conceived
with his DNA from the Kazons. The crew come up with a variety of tactical
options in the likely event of a Kazon trap including holographic decoy
ships and help from a nearby Talaxian colony, and Janeway decides to assume
that Seska and the child are in actual danger. A Kazon life pod is discovered,
carrying Tiernah, one of Cullah's aides who has apparently fallen out of
favor with the Maje. He volunteers information on a safe path through Kazon
space which results in a number of minor hit-and-run Kazon attacks. Janeway
becomes suspicious when all the attacks focus on one seemingly unimportant
part of Voyager and orders the ship to double back on its course, only
to find a well-organized Kazon ambush. Tiernah detonates a kamikaze bomb
implanted in his own body, and the attacks render the ship completely helpless,
unable even to self-destruct. Suder, the Betazoid crewman who has been
confined for murder, goes into hiding in the ship's ducting. Tom Paris
takes a shuttle to go back and retrieve help from the Talaxians, but contact
with him is lost in the ensuing battle. Cullah and the Kazons board Voyager
with Seska in tow and take command of the ship. The entire crew is left
on a primitive planet without any technology, and Janeway can only watch
helplessly as the crew's only hope to reach home rises into the sky and
off into space under the control of the Kazons. </LI>

to survive against both the elements and a group of primitive cave-dwellers.
Aboard the captured Voyager, the Doctor and recovering sociopath Lon Suder
form an alliance to try to wrest control back from Cullah's boarding party
while Tom Paris seeks help from a distant group of Talaxians. Suder makes
the greatest sacrifice of all as he finds he must release the dark side

but at the sight of it on the viewscreen Tuvok experiences a flashback
to what is apparently a traumatic experience in his youth. Yet it is <I>not</I>
an episode from Tuvok's past and the Doctor has no explanation, except
for the observation that Tuvok's neural synapses break down each time the
&quot;memory&quot; returns. When Tuvok begins to express concern over finding
cloaked Klingon ships &quot;this close to Klingon space,&quot; he decides
to regress using the technique of the Vulcan mind meld, asking Janeway
to be his guide and counselor. She joins in his memory as an outside observer
to objectify the experience. Yet he does not return to the memory in question
but to a memory of his first deep-space assignment, 80 years previously
aboard the Excelsior. It is here that the source of the mystery lies, but
they are fighting time as Tuvok's neural synapses continue to degrade and
Janeway suddenly becomes a participant in Tuvok's memory and not just an
observer. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 50156.2:</I> Harry Kim, disoriented and injured, finds
himself in a circle of brutal thugs, his new neighbors in an alien prison
camp. Harry finds help in the form of fellow prisoner Tom Paris, and they
begin trying to escape, but their efforts are hindered by rising tempers,
caused by implants that stimulate random, violent impulses. Janeway receives
word that Kim and Paris have been convicted of a terrorist bombing on a
planet they were visiting, and that the sentence - lifetime imprisonment
in an inpenetrable location - has already been carried out. Paris and Kim
find that the only escape possible from their prison is through a chute
that is protected by a lethal force field, but during an attempt to short
out the chute's defenses they are attacked and Tom suffers a severe stab
wound. The Voyager crew track down the real terrorists, but by the time
Janeway can win a confession and clear her crewmates' names, their cellmates
may have murdered them - or they may have killed each other. </LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> En route back to Voyager, the shuttle carrying
Paris and Torres is boarded by two unfamiliar alien lifeforms, who render
the Voyager crewmembers unconscious and then leave. Voyager recovers the
shuttle, but as the Doctor treats the badly injured Paris, he suffers from
an increasing memory loss that he first encountered while running an opera
program on the holodeck. Kes notices the Doctor's forgetfulness and alerts
Torres to the problem. One easy solution would be to completely reinitialize
the Doctor, but he would lose every memory of the past two years. Trying
to salvage the wealth of information and relationships the Doctor has established,
Torres calls up a holodeck diagnostic simulation of the Doctor's creator,
Dr. Zimmerman. In the meantime, Janeway's decision to stealthily pass through

signs of visitors from the Alpha Quadrant on a primitive planet. Chakotay
and Paris make an incognito visit to a location where sensors have detected
a replicator in use, only to find a village of humanoids who seem obsessed
with charging money for any goods or services, no matter how insignificant.
At the heart of this culture lie two Ferengi, stranded in the Delta Quadrant
since they were trapped by the Barzan Wormhole discovered by the Enterprise
seven years earlier. The Ferengi have come to this society as gods bearing
wisdom - the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition - but their true motive is to
exploit the native population for their own gain. Janeway sets a plan into
motion which involves Neelix masquerading as an envoy from the Grand Nagus.
But if his disguise fails to fool the Ferengi, he may find that these profit-mongerers
will do anything to keep their grasp on godhood. </LI>

denizens from a colony to their home world, B'elanna experiences an intense
dream about a member of their race, even though the object of her fascination
is not one of Voyager's passengers. B'elanna's dreams take stranger turns
as they progress along a continuing path, telling her a specific story
from the past, from point of view of one of the passengers. Though allegations
of telepathic interference are denied, B'elanna finally encounters the
person whose memories have been transmitted to her - an elderly woman who
dies immediately after sending B'elanna the last of her experiences involving
a rebel faction of the aliens' population which was massacred for opposing
the government. B'elanna believes that the woman whose life she experienced
was murdered by someone trying to cover up the truth about the alien's
violent history - and since she now possesses the secret, she may be next.

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> A brief encounter with a vessel whose lone
occupant claims to be a Federation time scout from 500 years in the future
results in a fierce firefight. The future captain describes a cataclysmic
disaster in the 29th century resulting from an incident that Voyager is
about to initiate. The timeship is damaged in the ensuing battle and falls
back into the temporal rift through which it arrived, which also drags
Voyager in. Voyager is taken back to Earth, 1996, and faint signs are detected
of the timeship. Janeway, Chakotay, Paris and Tuvok beam down incognito
to search for the wayward vessel, but unknown to them their own ship has
been detected in orbit by an astronomy graduate named Rain Robinson. Rain
contacts computer magnate Henry Starling, who is in possession of the timeship
while its original occupant languishes on the streets of Los Angeles. Tom
and Tuvok make their way to Griffith Observatory to erase Rain's evidence
of Voyager's presence, but she catches them in the act and is hot on their
trail as one of Starling's employees attempts to kill them all. Janeway
and Chakotay break into Starling's office and discover that he has already
contaminated the timeline, using the timeship's technology to jump-start
the computer revolution. Starling finds the uninvited guests and threatens
them, but Harry, left in command of Voyager, rescues them just in time.
But Starling still has the timeship - and worse yet, Voyager's low-orbit
rescue run has been detected by cameras on 20th century Earth. </LI>

chief and struggles with Janeway. Kes and the other refugees steal a shuttlecraft

who has developed the ability to transfer his consciousness into the minds
of others to insure his immortality. Tieran kills the rightful ruler of
his people and assumes power, trying to coerce the youngest heir into backing

in her quarters by Q, who claims to want to mate with her. Naturally, Janeway
rebuffs Q's every advance, and eventually a female member of the Q Continuum
appears, claiming that she is bonded to Q. As an argument ensues between
the Qs, more imminent supernovae are detected and Janeway orders the ship
clear of the destruction, but with so many stars exploding, Voyager can't
avoid all of the shockwaves. Just before the first wave hits the ship,
Q whisks Janeway into a representation of the Q Continuum in the context
of the American Civil War. Q explains that the Continuum is in the throes
of its own civil war, sparked by the death of a fellow Q he prosecuted
on charges that a Q suicide would imbalance their whole society. Q's desire
to mate with Janeway is the result of his belief that, from his past experiences
with Janeway and Picard, a hybrid child would introduce the omnipotent
Q to the nobility of humans. Caught in a civil war among immortal beings,
and hoping that her crew can enlist the help of the Q's scorned mate, Janeway
tries to negotiate a peace with the Q traditionalists...but she's unaware

punch their way through doors and equipment, and a chance encounter with
one of the aliens results in Neelix's disappearance. Janeway arms herself
as she tries to find out what has happened to her crew, and encounters

by an insect-like airborne virus. She makes her way to sickbay and the
Doctor describes an ill-fated humanitarian mission that resulted in the
infection of the entire Voyager crew. The virus breeds as a microscopic
organism and grows to its insect-like size to leave its victims' bodies,
finally evolving into a monster-sized attacker that seeks out new prey.

<LI><I>Stardate 50622.4:</I> While exploring the Nekrit Expanse in a shuttle,
Chakotay responds to a distress call which recognizes their Federation
signature, but when he goes to the surface to investigate he runs into
a firefight between rival factions. Meanwhile, Voyager runs into an abandoned
Borg cube adrift in space. It turns out that the people on the planet were
once a part of the Borg collective, but the link was severed about five
years previously and they fell into anarchy. A small group of the castaways
tries to enlist Chakotay's help to bring some order to the society, but
the Voyager crew is concerned that this action would re-awaken the Borg
ship.</LI>

<LI><I>Stardate 50693.2:</I> The Doctor attempts to modify himself by adding
behavioral subroutines while the Voyager crew treats with the Mikhal Travelers,
trading supplies for information on the Nekrit Expanse. But while the Travelers
seem very helpful, and Kes becomes romantically involved with one of their
pilots, a strange series of changes begins to take place in the Doctor.
The new subroutines seem to have created an alter ego which is becoming
separate from the Doctor's normal personality. He begins to display a violent
jealousy over Kes' blossoming relationship, combined with the ruthlessness
to carry out his intentions. B'ellana's efforts to help modify his program
only brings the ship, crew, and especially Kes closer to danger.</LI>

<LI><I>Stardate not given:</I> Neelix joins a crew attempting to help Nezu
colonists during a series of asteroid collisions. Voyager fails in its
attempt to vaporize an incoming asteroid and discovers that they're artificially
guided. When Neelix and Tuvok are abandoned on the planet just before the
next scheduled asteroid strike, they and some colonists use a maglift carriage
to climb an orbital tether to a point where they can contact the ship.
But one of the Nezu is determined to keep the others from passing on what
they know. As the carriage rises into the thinning atmosphere, they discover
what the real motivation behind both the asteroids and the surrounding
secrecy is.</LI>
